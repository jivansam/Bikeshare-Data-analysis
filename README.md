 Conclusion

 It can be seen from the graphs that cyclist subscribers use the bikes consistently every day for a brief period of time, but customers utilize them more inconsistently. On average, customers ride for significantly longer periods of time than subscribers, yet they ride bikes less often during the week and more on Saturdays and Sundays. In short, customers mostly use the service for leisure and enjoyment, while subscribers utilize it primarily for transportation for their everyday routines.

**Key Recommendations**

Place advertisment at the top 20 bike stations where customer users book from. In addition, place advertisement at high traffic areas in the city. These are the places that customers would possibly work, attend school or grab a bite to eat with family and friends.

Create a quirky and relatable skit on social media platforms to reach audience members of every age. This will result in big engagement numbers and a curiosity that will result in more subscribed members. In addition, run an ad that dispalys a short second survey question that the company is trying to collect data on. Collecting the data from the short second survey will be benefical to the company's growth.

According to the data, customers use the bike share on the weekends more. Offering a weekend only subscription will result in customers enjoying the bike share service. In addition, create a special-offer when you upgrade from weekend only subscription to annual subscription.
